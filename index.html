        <h1>The Art of Cho Gi-Seok</h1>
        <p>Cho Gi-Seok is a current artist I've discovered a couple of months ago on Instagram.His way of photographing surreal things and mixing life with fantasy is what really intrigued me to follow his art journey on social media. His work is now being discovered and admired by celebrity's such as Kali Uchis and Kylie Jenner.
